Seas of the World
=================

# Overview
Idea by [Johan Gahnstrom](https://github.com/JohanGahnstrom) on 
[OpenTravelData (OPTD) issue #140](https://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/issues/140):
```text
IHO has a specification "Limits of Oceans and Seas" (1953):
https://iho.int/uploads/user/pubs/standards/s-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf.
Attempts have been made to update this publication a number of times
but there are issues with a number of sea areas that cannot be resolved.
Hence, the 1953 is still valid. There is an implementation
on all the coordinates available here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/openseamap/files/jseas.zip

I thought it might be useful for this project to make available
names of the seas as a part of it.
```
