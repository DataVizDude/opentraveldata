# Overview
The [original of that documentation file](http://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/blob/master/data/unlocode/README.md)
is maintained on the [OpenTravelData (OPTD) project](http://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata),
within the [`data/unlocode` directory](http://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/blob/master/data/unlocode).

See also the [section on how to update UN/LOCODE data in the main
`README`](http://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/blob/master/tools/README.md#update-the-unlocode-data-file)

## Country sub-divisions
In the Zip archive of UN/LOCODE data files, there is a CSV file
with the administrative sub-divisions per country.
[That file](https://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/tree/master/data/unlocode/archives/unece-subdivision-codes-2019-1.csv)
seems to be encoded with various code plans, including `CP1252`.
In order to convert the `CP1252` part, you can do something like:
```bash
$ iconv -f CP1252 -t UTF-8 unece-subdivision-codes-2019-1.csv | less
```
However, any conversion will wrongly encode other parts. So, the best
is not to convert the character encoding of that file.

A simple `dos2unix` conversion is however recommended:
```bash
$ dos2unix unece-subdivision-codes-2019-1.csv
``` 

# Details

## Function
Each defined function gets a classifier; the most important ones are:
* 1: port (for any kind of waterborne transport)
* 2: rail terminal
* 3: road terminal
* 4: airport
* 5: postal exchange office
* 6: Inland Clearance Depot â€“ ICD or "Dry Port", "Inland Clearance Terminal", etc.
* 7: fixed transport functions (e.g. oil platform)"; the classifier "7" is reserved for this function. Noting that the description "oil pipeline terminal" would be more relevant, and could be extended to cover also electric power lines and ropeway terminals.
* B: Border crossing function
* 0: function not known, to be specified
