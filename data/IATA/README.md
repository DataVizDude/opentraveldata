IATA had the list of its POR available on a hidden directory of their Web site:
http://www.iata.org/codes/_li/li.txt

However, from around 2011, they have ceased to do so. The IATA airports and
airlines can now be searched through their online service:
http://www.iata.org/publications/Pages/code-search.aspx

The data files stored in this directory structure correspond to manually curated
data, thanks to the above mentionned Web site and to Wikipedia.
